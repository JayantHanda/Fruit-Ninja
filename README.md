This is my WOC 7.0 project "Fruit Ninja". 

Above are various folders that contain the various html pages that all together make the game.

The only difference between the simple and the super sword is that the super sword gives twice the amount of points as the simple sword.

In order to cut the fruit, the user must hold either left or right click.

The refresh rate should be set to 60Hz or else the game will not function as intended. 

I have tried my very best for making the UI as friendly to different screens and aspect ratios as possible but apologise in advance for any issues that might occur.
